Multi-Stream-File-Transfer
==========================

A Prototype Android app which allows for faster P2P file transfer 

**=== Idea ===**  
To transfer a large file using multiple wireless interfaces of two mobile phones. The idea is that by transferring multiple data streams simultaneously,  the transmission bandwidth i.e performance; will improve.  

- Client is installed on sending phone.
- Server is installed on receiving phone.
- Connection to a specific phone ID is hard-coded; modify this in code (connection functions) to suite other purposes.
- File to be sent is also hard-coded and must be changed in the code to suit other purposes.
- Uses Wifi-Direct and Blue-Tooth wireless interfaces simultaneously to transfer a file.
- # BUG: Data transferred by Blue-Tooth is sometimes partially corrupted.
